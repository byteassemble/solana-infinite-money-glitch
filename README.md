## Description 
Infinite Money Glitch ($IMG) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project built on the Solana blockchain. It leverages the advanced tax extension capabilities of the Token2022 program to create a unique reward system for token holders. This documentation provides an overview of the $IMG project, its key features, and its integration with the Token2022 program.
The $IMG project implements a seamless 5% tax on all transactions, including buying, selling, and transferring tokens. This tax is automatically collected and distributed to token holders in SOL, providing them with a sustainable passive income stream. The reward distribution is proportional to the holding size, meaning that the more $IMG tokens a holder has, the higher their SOL yield.
  
## Key Features:
* Automated SOL Rewards: Holders receive Solana directly to their wallets.
* Proportional Distribution: Rewards scale with the holding size.
* Fair Tax Structure: Consistent 5% tax across all transactions ensures market stability.
* Token2022 Integration: Utilizing Solana's Token2022 program for enhanced efficiency and security.
* Transparent Distribution: All reward calculations and distributions are verifiable on-chain.

The Infinite Money Glitch ecosystem aims to reward long-term holders while maintaining market liquidity. By implementing the tax at the token program level, the project offers a more efficient and secure reward system compared to traditional reflection tokens.
